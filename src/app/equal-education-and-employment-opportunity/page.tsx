              In 1868, Ezra Cornell wrote, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." 
              More than 150 years later, the "... any person ... any study" principle continues to guide the university community. 
              Cornell welcomes students, faculty, and staff with diverse backgrounds from across the globe to pursue world-class 
              education and career opportunities.

              Consequently, no person will be denied admission to any education program or activity, nor will anyone be denied 
              employment, on the basis of any legally protected status or subjected to prohibited discrimination involving, but 
              not limited to, such factors as race, ethnic or national origin, citizenship and immigration status, color, sex, 
              pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions, age, creed, religion, actual or perceived disability (including persons 
              associated with such a person), arrest and/or conviction record, military or veteran status, sexual orientation, 
              gender expression and/or identity, an individual's genetic information, domestic violence victim status, familial 
              status, marital status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local law.

              Cornell University embraces diversity in its workforce and seeks job candidates who will contribute to a climate 
              that supports students, faculty, and staff of all identities and backgrounds. We hire based on merit, and encourage 
              applications from all qualified individuals, including people from underrepresented and/or marginalized identities. 
              Consistent with federal law, Cornell engages in affirmative action in employment for qualified protected veterans 
              as defined in the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRRA) and qualified individuals with 
              disabilities under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act. Cornell also recognizes a lawful preference in employment 
              practices for Native Americans living on or near Indian reservations in accordance with applicable law.
