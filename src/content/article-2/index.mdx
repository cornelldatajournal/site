# The Hidden Costs of Green Finance

Our six-month investigation into the environmental finance industry reveals a complex web of competing interests, regulatory gaps, and unintended consequences that challenge the sector's effectiveness[^1].

## ESG Ratings: A Broken System?

Analysis of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings across major providers shows troubling inconsistencies. The same company can receive wildly different sustainability scores depending on the rating agency, raising questions about the reliability of these crucial metrics[^2].

## Carbon Markets Under Scrutiny

Our investigation into voluntary carbon markets uncovered systematic issues:

- Double-counting of carbon credits
- Questionable additionality claims
- Lack of standardized verification
- Indigenous land rights violations

These findings suggest fundamental problems in how carbon offsets are created and traded[^3].

## The Greenwashing Challenge

Through extensive document analysis and interviews with over 50 industry insiders, we tracked the flow of "green" capital through major financial institutions. Our findings indicate that many "sustainable" investment products may not deliver their promised environmental benefits[^4].

## Regulatory Gaps

Despite the rapid growth of green finance products, regulatory frameworks remain fragmented and inadequate. This investigation identifies critical oversight gaps that enable questionable practices to persist[^5].
