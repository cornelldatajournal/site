Environmental finance has emerged as a trillion-dollar industry, promising to redirect capital toward sustainable initiatives. But our investigation reveals a complex web of competing interests, regulatory gaps, and unintended consequences[^1].

Our analysis of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings across major providers shows troubling inconsistencies. The same company can receive wildly different sustainability scores depending on the rating agency, raising questions about the reliability of these crucial metrics[^2].

The investigation into voluntary carbon markets revealed several concerning issues. We found evidence of double-counting of carbon credits, questionable additionality claims, lack of standardized verification, and indigenous land rights violations. These findings suggest systemic issues in how carbon offsets are created and traded[^3].

Through extensive document analysis and interviews with 50+ industry insiders, we tracked the flow of "green" capital through major financial institutions. Our findings indicate that many "sustainable" investment products may be engaging in greenwashing[^4].

Despite the rapid growth of green finance products, regulatory frameworks remain fragmented and inadequate. This investigation identifies critical gaps in oversight that enable questionable practices to persist[^5]. ESG ratings continue to lack standardization and transparency, while carbon market verification systems show significant flaws. Green investment products often fail to deliver their promised impact, and regulatory oversight struggles to keep pace with market growth.
