Our six-month investigation into the environmental finance industry reveals a complex web of competing interests, regulatory gaps, and unintended consequences that challenge the sector's effectiveness[^1]. The findings paint a troubling picture of an industry struggling to deliver on its promises.

Analysis of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings across major providers shows troubling inconsistencies. The same company can receive wildly different sustainability scores depending on the rating agency, raising questions about the reliability of these crucial metrics[^2]. This lack of standardization undermines the entire premise of ESG investing.

Our investigation into voluntary carbon markets uncovered systematic issues that threaten their credibility. We found evidence of double-counting of carbon credits, questionable additionality claims, lack of standardized verification, and indigenous land rights violations. These findings suggest fundamental problems in how carbon offsets are created and traded[^3], casting doubt on their effectiveness as a climate solution.

Through extensive document analysis and interviews with over 50 industry insiders, we tracked the flow of "green" capital through major financial institutions. Our findings indicate that many "sustainable" investment products may not deliver their promised environmental benefits[^4]. The gap between marketing claims and reality raises serious concerns about greenwashing in the industry.

Despite the rapid growth of green finance products, regulatory frameworks remain fragmented and inadequate. This investigation identifies critical oversight gaps that enable questionable practices to persist[^5]. Without stronger regulation and standardization, the environmental finance sector may struggle to achieve its stated goals of supporting sustainable development.
