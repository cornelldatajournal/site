2,300 acres, sixteen libraries, 10 dining halls, 30 on campus eateries, 260 major academic buildings, eight undergraduate colleges, and over 26,000 total students all make up Cornellâ€™s grand (and at times difficult to navigate) campus. With all of these people to see, places to study, and food to try it is hard to find your ideal spot for any activity on campus. These interactive maps, made with dataderived from real student polls, illuminate study, social, and eating hotspots on campus

As we explore the frequency of student congregations in recreational centers such as outdoor spaces, fitness centers, and, in our case, libraries, this project showcases areas of high free time activity. It becomes a valuable tool for event planning, offering a strategic lens for effective event organization and promotion of social interactions. It may also give you insight on where *not* to go when it's time to lock in.

## Cramming: Studying Hotspots

Navigating the delicate balance between academic rigor and free time, study time often bleeds into social time. Unsurprisingly, we observe that many Cornell students often choose the same locations for both studying and spending their free time.

## Supplemental Info: Respondent Demographics 

Understanding the respondents of our survey is worthwhile in analyzing the insights we derive. It is important to note that it was optional to provide the additional information of major, year, and college on our survey. These demographic visualizations portray information based on the people who decided to provide it. Determining respondent demographics provides insight on potential bias in the data and results, and to whom these maps may be the most relevant.
