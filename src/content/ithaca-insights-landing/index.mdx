## Introducing: [ithacainsights.com](https://ithacainsights.com/)

Ithaca Insights is an interactive dashboard made through the findings illustrated [in this article](https://cornelldatajournal.org/articles/ithaca-insights). The dashboard shows how rental prices across Tompkins County compare to fair market value. It pulls real-time parcel data from Cornell and maps where properties may be over or underpriced based on a range of factors.

The goal is simple: *let’s make renting a house more simple and more transparent*. By mapping the gap between listed rents and assessed value, the dashboard helps Cornellians—and anyone else curious—find better deals and see where the market drifts from reality.

Each parcel appears as a dot. Green means a good deal and red means overpriced. The map updates with every new scrape. This level of visibility has not been easy to get before. **Ithaca Insights** brings it all into one place, clearly and cleanly, to help people make more informed decisions about rent, fairness, and access.
