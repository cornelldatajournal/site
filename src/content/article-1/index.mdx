# Introduction to Data Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data[^1].

## Basic Principles

Let's start with a simple scatter plot that demonstrates the relationship between two variables:

<PlotLoader plotId="scatter-plot-1" />

This plot shows how we can represent two-dimensional data points while also encoding a third variable (category) using color[^2].

## Trends Over Time

Time series data is often best represented using line plots:

<PlotLoader plotId="line-plot-1" />

The line plot above shows a clear upward trend in our monthly values, with some natural fluctuations[^3].

## Key Takeaways

1. Visual representations make patterns easier to spot
2. Interactive elements enhance understanding
3. Color coding adds another dimension to your data
4. Different chart types serve different purposes
